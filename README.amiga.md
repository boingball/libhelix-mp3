# AmigaOS 3 / m68k-amigaos-gcc port notes

This tree now has a correctness-first Amiga m68k backend in `real/assembly.h`.
Define `AMIGA_M68K` when building for AmigaOS 3, or rely on the automatic
GNU m68k target detection used by m68k-amigaos-gcc.
The backend deliberately uses portable C `long long` fixed-point helpers first;
68020 inline assembly optimizations should be added only after comparing their
output against this fallback.

## Minimal decoder build

Build the command-line decoder with the public decoder files, the common table
file, every portable RealNetworks backend C file, and the `pub`/`real` include
paths:

```sh
m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -Ipub -Ireal \
  -o amiga_mp3dec amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
```

Or use the checked-in convenience makefile so the include paths and `-D` flags
stay separated correctly:

```sh
make -f Makefile.amiga
```

For the experimental 68030 fast build, use:

```sh
make -f Makefile.amiga fast030
```

The equivalent expanded command is:

```sh
m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68030 -std=gnu89 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer \
  -Ipub -Ireal \
  -DAMIGA_M68K -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32 \
  -DAMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_POLYPHASE \
  -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_IMDCT -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_MIDSIDE \
  -o amiga_mp3dec.fastexp amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c \
  real/amiga_m68k_polyphase.S
```

Keep a space between every `-D...` define and every `-I...` include path.  For
example, `-DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_MIDSIDE-Ipub` is parsed as one malformed macro
definition, so the compiler never receives the `pub` include path and then fails
with missing `mp3dec.h`/`mp3common.h` errors.  Likewise,
`DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_IMDCT` without the leading `-D` is treated as an input file name
instead of a preprocessor define.


`--exp-poly` selects the additional experimental 68030 mono polyphase
assembly path in `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_POLYPHASE` builds when
`real/amiga_m68k_polyphase.S` is linked.  If the macro is set but the optional
assembly source is omitted, the weak asm reference resolves as unavailable and
the decoder falls back to the existing `AMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE` C path instead of
failing at link time.  Without the runtime argument, the older experimental
polyphase remains in use so target profiling can compare both variants.

The command-line decoder embeds an AmigaOS `$STACK:250000` cookie, requesting a
minimum 250,000-byte stack without requiring users to run the `Stack` command
first.

For a native smoke build on a non-Amiga host, use a portable backend define such
as `-D__riscv` only if your compiler supports the helper assembly for that
architecture; otherwise build with `-DAMIGA_M68K` to exercise the plain-C
fallback.

On a real 68020+ target, the Huffman cache's full 16-bit refill uses one
potentially unaligned `move.w` through `LOADBE16`.  No `REV16` byte swap is
needed because m68k is already big-endian.  68000/68010 and non-m68k smoke
builds retain the safe two-byte C fallback.

### Playback cleanup diagnostics

Playback resources are owned by one audio-player lifecycle and released through a
single cleanup path. `--debug-cleanup` reports reaped/aborted writes, device and
Exec object deletion, Chip/work-buffer release, debug-build canary checks, and
input-file closure. `--selftest-play-cleanup` repeats a tiny silent
`audio.device` submission and complete teardown five times; the older
`--play-lifecycle-test` spelling remains as an alias.

The playback implementation does not call `CurrentDir()`, `Lock()`, `Forbid()`,
`Permit()`, `Disable()`, or `Enable()`, so playback cleanup does not own a current
directory lock or interrupt/task-switch nesting state.

## Usage

```sh
amiga_mp3dec [options] infile.mp3 outfile
amiga_mp3dec --info infile.mp3
amiga_mp3dec --play [--stereo] [--rate 8287|8820|11025|22050] [--buffer-seconds N] [--fast-mem] infile.mp3
amiga_mp3dec --selftest-play-cleanup [--debug-cleanup] [--buffer-seconds N]
```

Default output is raw signed 16-bit big-endian PCM. If `outfile` names an
Amiga volume or directory and ends in `:`, `/`, or `\`, the decoder creates
an output file there from the input basename, using `.pcm`, `.s8`, or `.8svx`
for the selected output format.  For example, `RAM:` with `song.mp3` writes
`RAM:song.pcm`. Options:

- `--mono` mixes stereo input down to mono before writing.
- `--s8` writes raw signed 8-bit PCM.
- `--8svx` writes mono Amiga IFF-8SVX signed 8-bit output.
- `--fibdelta` writes 8SVX with Fibonacci Delta compression. The compressed
  `BODY` contains the two D1 predictor bytes plus one packed delta nibble per
  `oneShotHiSamples` output sample, so odd sample counts end with a padded low
  nibble.
- `--bench` prints elapsed time, realtime decode speed, and timing buckets for
  frame decode, PCM conversion/downsampling, 8SVX writing, Fibonacci
  compression, and low-level file writes. In `--play` mode it also prints the
  audio-device underrun count. Playback mode always prints underruns at exit so
  target runs can show whether streaming kept up.
- `--info` prints the input file size, ID3v2 text metadata and embedded-artwork
  size, first MPEG audio frame details, and ID3v1 metadata when present. Used as
  `--info infile.mp3`, it exits after inspection without decoding. It can also
  be combined with `--play` (or a normal decode command) to print the metadata
  before playback or decoding begins.
- `--play` is an experimental AmigaOS Paula streaming mode for CD32/TF330-style
  68030 testing. It opens `audio.device`, decodes to mono signed 8-bit PCM into
  Fast RAM work buffers, and bulk-copies each completed half-buffer into the
  chip-memory buffers submitted to `audio.device`. The default playback rate is
  8287 Hz for 030 safety; `--rate 8820` and `--rate 11025` are accepted, and `--rate 22050`
  is also accepted as an experimental/high-CPU mono-first mode that may underrun
  on 030 systems. Playback rates imply `--fast-lowrate`; 22050 Hz fast-lowrate
  playback prints `22050 requires significantly more CPU and may underrun on
  030 systems.`
  Playback prints the requested and actual output rates when fixed stride output
  differs, and calculates the PAL audio period from the actual output rate using
  rounded `3546895 / actual_output_rate` ticks, so 22050 Hz uses period 161.
  Playback automatically uses the reduced-
  overhead fast path: checksums run only with `--checksum`, timing buckets and
  decode-core profiling run only with `--bench`, and export/8SVX/Fibonacci state
  is not touched while streaming to `audio.device`.
- `--stereo` is opt-in only and applies only with `--play`. It keeps the default
  mono path unchanged, writes signed 8-bit samples per channel, preserves decoded
  left/right channels for stereo MP3 input where possible, and duplicates mono
  MP3 input to both output channels. Streaming stereo playback opens separate
  `audio.device` allocations for one left Paula channel and one right Paula
  channel, converts decoded interleaved signed 16-bit PCM into planar signed
  8-bit Fast RAM work buffers, and uses one bulk copy per channel into the
  Paula chip-memory submission buffers when each half-buffer is submitted. Stereo
  supports `--rate 8820` and `--rate 11025` first; `--rate 22050` is allowed
  only as an experimental/high-CPU stereo mode. `--rate 8287` is mono-only.
  Enabling stereo prints `Stereo playback needs significantly more CPU and may
  underrun on 030.`
- `--play-fast-path` is accepted as an explicit alias for `--play`; the normal
  `--play` mode already uses this reduced-overhead streaming path.
- `--buffer-seconds N` chooses the requested playback depth for each half of the
  `--play` double buffer; the default is 4 seconds for safer 030 playback. Values
  must be positive integers; values above 10 seconds are clamped to 10 seconds.
  Playback now keeps separate Fast RAM conversion buffers and chip-memory
  `audio.device` submission buffers; mono copies one completed half-buffer at
  submit time, while stereo copies the completed left and right planar buffers.
  If the requested 22050 Hz or stereo buffer set is too large for available
  memory, playback automatically retries with smaller
  half-buffers and prints the reduced byte count instead of failing immediately.
  Playback prints the selected half-buffer duration and byte size at startup, and
  reports total underruns, per-buffer underruns, late-buffer count, and the
  minimum measured spare time before a playing buffer ended at exit.
- `--fast-mem` preloads the complete compressed MP3 into Fast RAM before decoding
  or playback starts. On AmigaOS builds it requests `MEMF_FAST`, so the input
  does not consume chip RAM needed by Paula buffers. This removes filesystem and
  slow-HDD reads from the realtime decode/refill loop and prints the allocated
  byte count at startup. The option fails before playback if the complete input
  cannot be sized, read, or allocated; it never silently falls back to disk.
  Unlike `--decode-then-play`, it stores only the compressed MP3 and continues to
  decode into the normal double-buffered playback path, so it normally needs far
  less RAM. It intentionally preloads synchronously: background HDD I/O on a
  CPU-limited 68030 could still steal decode time at unpredictable points.
  For slow disks, start with `--play --fast-mem`; if decode-time spikes can still
  exhaust the queued audio, also increase `--buffer-seconds` toward 10.
- `--debug-play` prints startup diagnostics for Paula streaming, including the
  actual output rate, PAL period, requested buffer depth, selected half-buffer
  samples/bytes, chip submission buffer addresses/sizes, optional stereo work
  buffer addresses/sizes, buffer A/B fill samples/bytes, every A/B `CMD_WRITE`
  submit/complete milestone, underrun detections, and final cleanup counts for
  completed/aborted outstanding I/O, freed buffers, and closed audio devices. The
  streaming startup path
  allocates the playback buffers before pre-filling both A and B by decoded
  sample count (not amplitude), queues both non-empty buffers before rotation,
  refills the completed half while the queued half is playing, and never waits on
  an audio I/O request that has not been submitted. A silent first
  playback buffer is accepted so valid MP3 encoder delay, padding, or fade-ins
  can play normally; with `--debug-play`, an all-zero first buffer prints
  `first playback buffer is silent/near-silent`. Playback does not skip leading
  silence by default.
- `--decode-then-play` is a `--play` debug mode that decodes the whole MP3 to
  RAM as signed 8-bit PCM first (mono by default, or stereo with `--stereo`), then plays the resulting buffer via
  `audio.device`, which helps separate decoder/streaming issues from playback
  issues.
- `--play-lifecycle-test` opens playback, allocates the playback buffers, submits
  a short silent `CMD_WRITE`, cleans up, and repeats the sequence three times.
  Use it on real hardware with `--debug-play` to verify that repeated
  `audio.device` open/submit/abort-or-wait/close and buffer free cycles leave no
  stale requests or reply messages before testing longer MP3 streams.
- `--decode-only` decodes MP3 frames and skips PCM conversion plus all output.
  The output path argument is optional in this mode.
- `--no-output` runs PCM conversion/downsampling and 8SVX/Fibonacci compression
  paths but discards bytes instead of touching an output file.  The output path
  argument is optional in this mode.
- `--rate 22050`, `--rate 11025`, `--rate 8820`, or `--rate 8287` post-decode downsamples the
  output with a lightweight nearest-sample decimator when the MP3 sample rate is
  higher than the requested output rate.
- `--fast-lowrate` is an experimental, lower-quality Amiga conversion mode for
  speed experiments, not hi-fi playback. It requires one of the `--rate` values
  above. In `AMIGA_M68K` + `AMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE` builds it writes only every
  second polyphase output sample for 22050 Hz, every fourth for 11025 Hz, and
  every fifth for 8820/8287 Hz. This skips discarded polyphase sample work,
  appends emitted samples through one cumulative low-rate output counter, and
  keeps the low-rate phase/stride state alive across granules and MP3 frames.
  For exact integer strides such as 44100 -> 11025, fast-lowrate selects the
  same source positions as normal `--rate` decimation. The 8287 Hz mode uses a
  fixed stride of 5 for Amiga-rate experiments, so 44100 Hz input emits at
  8820 Hz and reports/plays/writes metadata at that actual emitted rate instead
  of labeling it as the requested 8287 Hz. For stride-2 22050 Hz output, the
  fast-polyphase build computes only the 16 even synthesis rows: a half-width
  FDCT path skips the unused factored-DCT half and polyphase evaluates only those
  16 output samples. The emitted PCM remains bit-identical to selecting every
  second sample from the full synthesis path. Huffman/dequant and IMDCT still
  run at full MP3 rate; stride-4/5 output still uses full FDCT32. Stereo input
  with `--mono` is collapsed in the decoder after required MPEG stereo
  reconstruction, so the
  right-channel IMDCT/FDCT32/polyphase work and full stereo PCM copy are skipped.
  Pure mid/side joint-stereo mono output also advances over the unused coded
  side-channel Huffman payload, removing a bitrate-sensitive decode cost.
  `--bench` reports the huffman, dequant, stereo/post, imdct, subband/dct32,
  and polyphase buckets used to profile that path.
- `--debug-fastlowrate` prints one line per decoded frame/granule with the
  full-rate sample count, low-rate samples emitted, cumulative low-rate samples,
  and destination offset range used for contiguous placement.
- `--selftest-mulshift` compares the portable C `MULSHIFT32` reference with the
  optional 68020+ assembly helper over edge cases and 100,000 pseudo-random
  input pairs.
- `--selftest-fdct32` compares `FDCT32_C_REFERENCE` against the normal `FDCT32`
  entry point, so `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32` builds can prove the optional asm
  multiply path preserves the C operation order and fixed-point outputs.
- `--selftest-imdct` compares the C IMDCT36 reference with the active IMDCT
  entry point over zero, random, edge-value, common long-window, and fallback
  window cases.
- `--selftest-polyphase` compares the C fast mono polyphase path with the active
  mono polyphase entry point, so `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_POLYPHASE` builds can prove the
  optional 68030 assembly kernel.  When the asm hook is active, `--exp-poly` also
  runs this selftest before enabling the playback/decode hot path.
- `--selftest-fastlowrate` compares a synthetic ramp/impulse-like PCM sequence
  through normal 44100 -> 11025 `--rate` decimation and the stride-4
  fast-lowrate selector across chunk boundaries.
- `--checksum` prints a 32-bit checksum of the decoded 16-bit PCM stream before
  optional mixing, downsampling, or output-format conversion. With
  `--fast-lowrate`, it instead covers the low-rate output samples so experiments
  can verify deterministic fast-lowrate output. Use it to compare the default
  polyphase path with optional optimized builds.
- `--debug-argv` or `--show-argv` prints `argc` and `argv` after Amiga
  command-tail normalization.  The normalizer also handles Amiga C runtimes
  that pass the whole command tail as one argument, including CR/LF
  whitespace and quoted paths.

The program prints the first decoded frame's input sample rate, output sample
rate when it differs, channel count, and bitrate when available, followed by
decoded frame count and output sample count.

## Optimization roadmap

1. Keep the C helper block as the reference backend for 68000 and non-GCC builds.
2. Benchmark with `--bench --decode-only`, `--bench --no-output`, and normal
   output on target hardware to separate frame decode, conversion/compression,
   and filesystem cost.
3. `AMIGA_M68K_ASM` currently optimizes `MULSHIFT32` with optional 68020+
   `muls.l` inline assembly.  Build and prove it before touching additional
   helpers:

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.asm amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   amiga_mp3dec.asm --selftest-mulshift
   ```

4. `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32` is an opt-in, exact FDCT32 arithmetic path for
   68020+ GNU m68k builds, tuned for the 68030.  It keeps `FDCT32_C_REFERENCE`
   callable and routes the normal `FDCT32` entry point through an
   operation-order-preserving transform.  The fully unrolled first radix-4
   pass is one register-scheduled machine-code region: butterfly values remain
   in data registers, coefficients stream through an address register, and
   `muls.l` high words feed the next operation without C compiler spill/reload
   boundaries.  The second pass currently uses a compact four-iteration
   assembly kernel with stable data-register roles rather than four unrolled
   copies.  That keeps code size down, but it is not assumed to be fastest on
   a 68030: benchmark a fully unrolled variant on the target too, because
   eliminating loop and branch overhead may outweigh the extra code size.  The
   two output-shuffle halves use bounded assembly regions that retain each
   reused sum while issuing the paired stores directly.  The rare guard-bit
   clipping/scaling pass remains in C.  This flag is
   deliberately disabled by default; leave it disabled if any checksum or
   `--selftest-fdct32` comparison differs from the C reference.

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32 -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm --selftest-fdct32
   ```


5. `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_IMDCT` is an opt-in exact long-block IMDCT36 path for
   68020+ GNU m68k builds.  The C IMDCT remains the reference; the active
   entry point uses a compact nine-iteration asm window/overlap kernel only
   for the common long-window case and falls back to C for short blocks,
   mixed/transition windows, start/stop windows, and anything else uncommon.
   This flag is disabled by default; do not enable it by default unless real
   mono plus stereo/high-bitrate target benchmarks improve and
   `--selftest-imdct` plus every required checksum remain identical.

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68030 -std=gnu89 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer \
     -DAMIGA_M68K -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM -DAMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE \
     -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32 -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_IMDCT -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.imdctasm amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   amiga_mp3dec.imdctasm --selftest-imdct
   ```

6. `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_POLYPHASE` is an opt-in, experimental 68030 mono fast
   polyphase kernel.  The C fast mono path remains callable as the reference;
   `--selftest-polyphase` compares it against the active asm hook, and
   `--exp-poly` reruns that check automatically before playback or decode
   selects the assembly path.

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68030 -std=gnu89 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer \
     -DAMIGA_M68K -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM -DAMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE \
     -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_POLYPHASE -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.polyasm amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c \
     real/amiga_m68k_polyphase.S
   amiga_mp3dec.polyasm --selftest-polyphase
   ```

7. `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_MIDSIDE` is an opt-in 68020+ GNU m68k implementation of
   the joint-stereo mid/side reconstruction loop.  It keeps both channel
   pointers and guard-bit masks in registers, uses `dbf` for the bounded
   sample loop, and performs each absolute value with a branchless
   `asr`/`eor`/`sub` sequence.  The shift count is held in a data register
   because m68k immediate shifts cannot encode 31.  Compare PCM checksums and
   benchmark stereo joint-stereo inputs on the target before enabling it by
   default.

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68030 -std=gnu89 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer \
     -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_MIDSIDE -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.midsideasm amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   amiga_mp3dec.midsideasm --bench --decode-only --checksum stereo-joint.mp3
   ```

7. Checksum the C and ASM FDCT32 builds with identical inputs and output modes
   before enabling the ASM binary in a release or local deployment.  The
   required regression set is: mono 56 kbps, stereo 160 kbps, stereo 256 kbps,
   fast-lowrate 11025 Hz, and fast-lowrate 8820 Hz.

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.c-ref amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -DAMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32 -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c

   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --decode-only --checksum mono-56.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm --bench --decode-only --checksum mono-56.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --decode-only --checksum stereo-160.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm --bench --decode-only --checksum stereo-160.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --decode-only --checksum stereo-256.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm --bench --decode-only --checksum stereo-256.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --no-output --fast-lowrate --rate 11025 --checksum stereo-160.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm --bench --no-output --fast-lowrate --rate 11025 --checksum stereo-160.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --no-output --fast-lowrate --rate 8820 --checksum stereo-160.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fdct32asm --bench --no-output --fast-lowrate --rate 8820 --checksum stereo-160.mp3
   ```

   On a 68030, compare `elapsed seconds`, `decode speed`, and, when built with
   `AMIGA_PROFILE_DECODE`, `timing core subband/dct32` between the C reference
   and ASM binaries.  If any PCM checksum differs, do not define
   `AMIGA_M68K_ASM_FDCT32` for the default build.

8. `AMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE` is an opt-in Amiga/m68k polyphase synthesis path
   for 68020+ builds.  It keeps the original implementation available when the
   flag is omitted, but replaces the 64-bit polyphase accumulator with 32-bit
   fixed-point high-multiply terms to reduce 68030 inner-loop overhead:

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -DAMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.fastpoly amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   ```

9. Compare default and `AMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE` builds with identical inputs,
   output modes, and checksum reporting:

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.c-ref amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   m68k-amigaos-gcc -m68020 -std=gnu89 -O2 -DAMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE -Ipub -Ireal \
     -o amiga_mp3dec.fastpoly amiga_mp3dec.c mp3dec.c mp3tabs.c real/*.c
   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --decode-only --checksum song.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fastpoly --bench --decode-only --checksum song.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.c-ref --bench --no-output --fibdelta --rate 22050 --checksum song.mp3
   amiga_mp3dec.fastpoly --bench --no-output --fibdelta --rate 22050 --checksum song.mp3
   ```

10. Check final Amiga binaries for libgcc 64-bit helper calls before measuring:

   ```sh
   m68k-amigaos-nm -u amiga_mp3dec.asm | egrep '__muldi3|__ashrdi3|__lshrdi3'
   ```

   `MULSHIFT32` should not add those calls when `AMIGA_M68K_ASM` is enabled.
   `AMIGA_FAST_POLYPHASE` should remove the polyphase dependency on `MADD64` and
   `SAR64`; any remaining helper symbols should be attributed to non-polyphase
   paths before investigating them one at a time.
